# AccessIt
An Online Library Management System.

Need of this Project:
  1.Importance of Digitalization during this pandemic situation.
  2.Manual Library management cannot sustain when there is need to store large amount of records. 
  3.Lack of security to the data and records.
  4.Maintaining records in file system is a very tedious task and may lead to human errors.
  5.We can’t ignore these issues and hence, establishing a computerized management system becomes the main trend.
  6.AccessIt – A LMS can become a perfect solution to all these issues.
  
Objective of the Project:
  1.The main objective of this project is to manage and organize the physical Library management through a Web-app.
  2.To reduce the paperwork and automate the work for the Librarian or admin and the User.
  3.To provide better security for managing records/data of the Library and the users.
  4.To make the data retrieval and updating faster (admin) and also make the issuance and return of the books easier for the Users.
  
Tools and Technologies used:
1.Front-end:
  a.HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language)
  b.CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets)
  c.JavaScript
  CSS framework : Bootstrap
2.Back-end:
  PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)
3.Database:
  MySQL
4.Other platforms:
  Xampp server, phpMyAdmin, Github
  
To foster technology-driven education, a Web-based LMS is in development to manage all library operations such as adding/deleting books,
updating user's records and handling the process of borrowing/returning books, etc.
Therefore, by proper analysis and assessment of the application to be designed, it is safely determined that “AccessIt” will be efficient, usable, and reliable LMS.
It will be working properly and adequately meet the minimum expectations which were proposed initially. 
The proposed application is expected to be a benefit to the users and staff/admins in terms of efficiency in the usage of the library system.
